 You also need an  with 2 push buttons AND with soldering strips in the middle originally intended for mounting Integrated Circuit packages (pics in a post below show its top & bottom). You also need:  a BC547 transistor, a DHT11 temperature / humidity sensor, a SSR-10DA (DC to AC) solid state relay, a supply of 22 gauge insulated wire (at least red, black, & yellow) plus tools & solder to assemble the above.  For a DS18 temperature sensor, you also need a 4.7 kilo ohms resistor. Some resistors (like for the DHT sensor) were eliminated via what I documented in thread Simplify End Node w Arduino internal pullup resistors.  Somewhat optional but recommended: more colors of wire & heat shrink tubing.
