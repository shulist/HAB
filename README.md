# Home Automation and Monitoring (HAM)
## Overview
This whole effort was inspired by https://github.com/computourist/RFM69-MQTT-client
This set of applications is intended to provide a networked solution to the problem of home automation and monitoring. The Three main applications that will accomplish this will be the following;
1) OpenHAB running on a <b>Raspberry</b> Pi (Ethernet)
2) MQTT broker running on an <b>Arduino</b> (using both radio and Ethernet)
3) Nodes running on an <b>Arduino</b> (using radio)
